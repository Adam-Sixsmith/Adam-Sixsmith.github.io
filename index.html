        <h1>About me!</h1>
        <p>
            Hey! I'm Adam Sixsmith. I've been working in a contact center environment for 14 years, and I'm currently a Team Leader. 
            Over the years, I've learned a lot about customer service, managing teams, and keeping everything running smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, I'm studying an undergraduate degree in Computing and IT with the Open University. I enjoy diving into software development and all things tech. 
            It's really exciting to be building on my real-world experience while learning new things in the tech world.
        </p>
        <p>
            When working and studying is done with, I enjoy spending time with my family, wether that's watching a movie or going on holiday!           
            I also enjoy playing video games to unwind, mainly Old School Runescape. I'm a big fan of Rugby. I've played for 13 years and am eagar to get back into it sometime in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself, whether it's through work, learning, or just picking up new hobbies.
        </p>

    <section id="skills">
        <h1>My Skills!</h1>
        <p>As mentioned above, I have been working in a contact center environment for 14 years. During that time, I have worked for a number of clients using various methods.
            I've been an agent on the phones delivering customer service, as well as helping customers get the best deals over webchat. I also sprinkled in a little system support along the way, leading to where I am now.
            I started my leadership career in August 2019 as a Deputy Team Leader, finding my feet and excelling in that role before becoming a full Team Leader in February 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy diving into a report or two and using the data to give my team the support they need to make their jobs easier and help them grow and develop their own skills.
            I would say I'm a people person and enjoy getting to know others, which helps in my role as a Team Leaderâ€”especially when it comes to motivating team members!
        </p>

    <section id="projects">
        <h1>My Projects!</h1>
        <p>
            I don't have much at the moment in the way of projects so this will get updated as I go along. I'm currently in the process of completing an undergraduate degree in computing and IT with the Open University
            So the experience I have with programming as a whole is the very basics at the moment (Hence building this website!).
        </p>

        <p>
            The projects I have built so far are mainly calculators for things in Old School Runescape. I've left links before to my Github page if you'd like to have a nosy!
