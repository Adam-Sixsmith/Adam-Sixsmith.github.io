        <h1>üëãAbout Me!üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>
        <p>
            Hey! I'm Adam Sixsmith. I've been working in a contact center environment for 14 years, and I'm currently a Team Leader. 
            Over the years, I've learned a lot about customer service, managing teams, and keeping everything running smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, I'm studying an undergraduate degree in Computing and IT with the Open University. I enjoy diving into software development and all things tech. 
            It's really exciting to be building on my real-world experience while learning new things in the tech world.
        </p>
        <p>
            When working and studying is done with, I enjoy spending time with my family, wether that's watching a movie or going on holiday!           
            I also enjoy playing video games to unwind, mainly Old School Runescape. I'm a big fan of Rugby. I've played for 13 years and am eagar to get back into it sometime in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself, whether it's through work, learning, or just picking up new hobbies.

        <h1>üõ†Ô∏èMy Skills!üßë‚Äçüíº</h1>
        <p>As mentioned above, I have been working in a contact center environment for 14 years. During that time, I have worked for a number of clients using various methods.
            I've been an agent on the phones delivering customer service, as well as helping customers get the best deals over webchat. I also sprinkled in a little system support along the way, leading to where I am now.
            I started my leadership career  in August 2019 as a Deputy Team Leader, finding my feet and excelling in that role before becoming a full Team Leader in February 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy diving into a report or two and using the data to give my team the support they need to make their jobs easier and help them grow and develop their own skills.
            I would say I'm a people person and enjoy getting to know others, which helps in my role as a Team Leader‚Äîespecially when it comes to motivating team members!

        <p>
            I don't have much at the moment in the way of projects so this will get updated as I go along. I'm currently in the process of completing an undergraduate degree in computing and IT with the Open University
            so the experience I have with programming as a whole is the very basics at the moment (Hence building this website!).
        </p>

        <p>
            The projects I have built so far are mainly calculators for things in Old School Runescape. I've left links below to my Github page if you'd like to have a nosy!
        </p>

                    <u> Old School Runescape Mahogany Homes Calculator </u>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While working on training construction in OSRS I made a Calculator for a minigame I was doing at the time to give me an idea on how many more contracts I had left to do. Click
                    the image on the right to see how it's made!

                <p>
                    When Jagex announced a new way to handle the Combat Achievement tiers we wanted a way to check to see which tier we would be in before it came out. I put this together for myself and clan friends to 
                    see where would be and what we needed to get to the next tier. Click the image to the left to see how it's made!

                <p>
                    While working on 99 Firemaking in Old School Runescape I put this Calculator together so I work out how many games of Wintertodt I had left to the next level. Kept me sane while getting
                    more programming experience! Click the image on the right to see how it's made!

        <p>Since the age of 7 I've enjoy playing Rugby and did so throughout my childhood into adulthood, that was until I got injured. Rugby's something I'd love to get back into, but for now I enjoy spending time with
            family and playing Old School Runescape, I do enjoy other video games, but OSRS takes my interest everytime.
